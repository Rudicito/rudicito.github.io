# about me

## Look at my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Rudicito)!

Hello, I'm **Rudi Herouard**, and I'm 19. I'm currently a first-year student in BTS SIO SLAM (a French technical IT degree program). I live in **France**, near **Paris**.

The work I'm only interested is **computer science**. It's the only work I feel like it suits me and feel capable I can do.

Here the things I feel competent enough:

## linux enjoyer
Since 3 years, I daily-drive **Linux**, on my laptop, and stop using **Windows**.

My first distro was [PopOS](https://system76.com/pop/), try some others, and finally switch to [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/).

In Fedora, my desktop was originally [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/), but I switch to [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) and recently to [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/).

The main software I use for coding is [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) apps, because I like the interface and how "smart" the hints are. Also, I like the **git** interface, how easy to use.

For more obscure language, I use vscode or something else. Maybe I should learn something like [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and vim keybind?

## hardware
I only use a laptop:

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7640U
- RAM: 32gb DDR5
- Storage: 1 tb
