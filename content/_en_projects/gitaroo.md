This project is still a work in progress. It aims to bring back the gameplay of [Gitaroo Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitaroo_Man), a rhythm game originally released in 2001, in [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/).

osu! is a well-known rhythm game, and with its official open-source client, it's possible to create custom game modes called “rulesets” in C#.

Once finished, this project will make it possible to play osu! user-made maps with Gitaroo Man gameplay.
