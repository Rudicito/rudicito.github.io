In high school, in our computer club, we built a remote-controlled tank. 

We built it using an Arduino, 4 motors for the wheels, a speaker for music, and a Bluetooth module for control.

It's controlled via Bluetooth with a phone, thanks to the Arduino's C++ code and the Bluetooth module, of course.

We finished it right at the last moment. I remember trying to get the speaker working with the Arduino on the bus (hehe).
