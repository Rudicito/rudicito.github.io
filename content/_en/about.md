# about me

## Look at my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Rudicito)!

Hello, I'm **Rudi Herouard**, and I'm 19. I'm currently a first-year student in BTS SIO SLAM (a French technical IT degree program). I live in **France**, near **Paris**.

The work I'm only interested is **computer science**. It's the only work I feel like it suits me and feel capable I can do.

Here are the things I feel competent enough:

## linux enjoyer
Since 3 years, I've daily-driven **Linux**, on my laptop, and stop using **Windows**.

My first distro was [PopOS](https://system76.com/pop/), try some others, and finally switch to [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/).

In Fedora, my desktop was originally [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/), but I switched to [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) and recently to [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/).

## code
The main software I use for coding is [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) apps, because I like the interface and how "smart" the hints are. Also, I like how the **[git](https://git-scm.com/)** interface is easy to use.

For more obscure languages not supported by JetBrains, I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## hardware
I only use a laptop:
[Framework Laptop 13](https://frame.work/laptop13):
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7640U
- RAM: 32gb DDR5
- Storage: 1 tb

I chose this laptop because it's powerful, easy to repair, and upgradeable (for example, I can replace the screen with a better one).
